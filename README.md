# bgp-dci-router-design
This repository contains a BGP network design for a INTERCONNECTION DATA CENTER topology as part of a Final Project. The network is divided into three sections:

- **Data Center DCI1**: Represented by Router RTR-AS100-DC1.
- **Data Center DCI2**: Represented by Routers RTR-1-AS200-DC2, RTR-2-AS200-DC2, and RTR-3-AS200-DC2.
- **Data Center DCI3**: Represented by Router RTR-AS-300-DC3.
  
## Features
**Protocol**: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
**Topology Simulation**: Created using EVE-NG.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
